  <h2>Mathew's Bible Findings</h2>

    <h1>Acts 1:1</h1>
  <section>
   <p><q>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the 
       Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen</q></p>
  </section>      
  
    <h2>Commentaries on Acts 1:1</h2>
 <section>
    <p>O Theophilus - See the notes on Luke 1:3. Since this book was written to 
       the same individual as the former, it was evidently written with the same
       design to furnish an authentic and full narrative of events concerning which
       there would be many imperfect and exaggerated accounts. See Luke 1:1-4. Since
       these events pertained to the descent of the Spirit, to the spread of the gospel,
       to the organization of the church, to the kind of preaching by which the 
       church was to be collected and organized, and as the facts in the case constituted
       a full proof of the truth of the Christian religion, and the conduct of the apostles
       would be a model for ministers and the church in all future times, it was of great 
       importance that a fair and full narrative of these things should be preserved. 
       Luke was the companion of Paul in his travels, and was an eye-witness of no 
       small part of the transactions recorded in this book.</p>

      <h1>Genesis 1:27</h1> 
 <section>    
      <p><q>So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him male and female created he them</q></p>
 </section>  


      <h2>Commentaries on Genesis 1:27</h1>
  <section>      
      <p>This was a peculiar distinction, the value attached to which appears in the     words being twice mentioned. And in what did this image of God consist? Not in the erect form or features of man, not in his intellect, for the devil and his angels are, in this respect, far superior; not in his immortality, for he has not, like God, a past as well as a future eternity of being; but in the moral dispositions of his soul, commonl called original righteousness ( Ecclesiastes 7:29 ). As the new creation is only a restoration of this image, the history of the one throws light on the other; and we are informed that it is renewed after the image of God in knowledge, righteousness, and true holiness ( Colossians 3:10 , Ephesians 4:24 ).</p>

         <h1>Proverbs 3:24</h1>
<section>
        <p><q> When you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet.</q></p>
</section>

        <h2>Commmentaries on Proverbs 3:24</h2>
<section>
        <p>assign reasons in their value for happiness and ornament, guidance and support in dangers, both when waking and sleeping.</p>

        <h1>Isaiah 45:3</h1>
  <section>      
        <p><q>I will give you hidden treasures, riches stored in secret places, so that you may know that I am the LORD, the God of Israel, who summons you by name.</q></p>
  </section>
         
      <h2>Commentaries on Isaiah 45:3</h2>
<section>
        <p>that is, hidden in subterranean places; a common Oriental practice. Sorcerers pretended to be able to show  where such treasures were to be found; in opposition to their pretensions, God says, He will really give hidden treasures to Cyrus ( Jeremiah 50:37 , 51:13 ). PLINY (Natural History,, 33:3) says that Cyrus obtained from the conquest of Asia thirty-four thousand pounds weight of gold, besides golden vases, and five hundred thousand talents of silver, and the goblet of Semiramis, weighing fifteen talents that thou mayest know--namely, not  merely that He was "the God of Israel," but that He was Jehovah, the true God. Ezra 1:1 Ezra 1:2 shows that the correspondence of the event with the prediction had the desired effect on Cyrus.</p>

     <h1>Hebrew 4:4</h1>
<section>
        <p><q>For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words: On the seventh day God rested from all his works.</q></p>
</section>

    <h2>Commentaries on Hebrew 4:4</h2>
<section>
        <p>he spake--God ( Genesis 2:2 ).God did rest the seventh day--a rest not ending with the seventh day, but beginning then and still continuing, into which believers shall hereafter enter. God's rest is not a rest necessitated by fatigue, nor consisting in idleness, but is that upholding and governing of which creation was the beginning [ALFORD]. Hence Moses records the end of each of the first six days, but not of the seventh.from all his works--Hebrew, Genesis 2:2 , "from all His work." God's "work" was one, comprehending, however, many "works."</p>
